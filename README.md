# Lego_Data_Collection_Analysis

This is a fun mini-project and I achieved the following goals in this project:
1. Built a Python crawler to obtain Lego data from Rebrickable API, visualized and published Lego graph using Argo Lite
2. Used SQL to analyze data stored in SQLite to find top Lego themes and explore the growth of Lego sets over time
